I've been struggling with personal productivity for awhile. I could say some drivel about the age of distraction with cell phones, Facebook, Twitter, Instgram, etc. but the reality is that it's harder than ever to get work done and feel like we're keeping up to the social expectations that we think others have for us. There also the classic irony of being distracted by the very medium that you are developing and creating for, along with using those very distraction to market your creations. Yadda yadda, blah blah, it's easy to get distracted and I just need to focus harder. Right?

I think there's alot more to it than that. I can't help but remember my childhood when after forgetting something small – a homework assignment, or after school play practice – my mother would berate me for not remembering and tell me that I just need to "remember harder." I'd always ask her what that meant, expecting some practical advice or specific action and she'd say that was it, I just needed to "remember harder." I can remember at least once getting so lividly angry to the point of screaming until my throat hurt at the utterly helpless and infuriating advice I was receiving. How does one simple "remember harder" anyway? How does one focus on work harder? Isn't that really asking a deeper question: How does one motivate oneself more?

I can't think of a clear way to describe the apparent inanity of that question the first time I really sat to think that over. How can you will yourself to be willing to do something that based on current observation, you aren't willing to do? Isn't that a circular dependency of sorts? If you could do that, wouldn't you have already done that by now? To be brutally honest, it's hard to clearly remember exactly what that felt like before I started studying the problem more and actually approaching it as a discipline that I could learn, not unlike how I've taught myself countless other disciplines (even including the ones that have led to multiple successful careers). Is it possible to step back from all this and actually start to analyze how my mind works and what can and will motivate it? I think so, but it definitely involves alot of different thinking including:

1. reducing guilt
2. realizing not alone in situation
3. realizing that it's a skill just like any other
4. It doesn't matter when I start (I didn't miss the boat by being late to GTD)
5. practice, practice, practice.
