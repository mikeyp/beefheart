<blockquote><p>If I’d had more time, I’d have written a shorter post.</p></blockquote>

Most of my life, I’ve only written when required. High school English class, college essays, etc. As a consequence writing always felt like a struggle to fill some pointless quota. More words, more sentences, more whatever, but only because I have to.

I don’t know when the switch flipped, but I have suddenly realized that my new struggle is to write less. Convey my thoughts, ideas, the important bits, with fewer words, less is more. **And it’s hard.**

I can’t help but wonder if all those years of writing to fill space has done some sort of damage that will take time to be undone.

Time will tell.
